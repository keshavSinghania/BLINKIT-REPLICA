# **BLINKIT-REPLICA**

A full-stack clone of **Blinkit** (formerly Grofers), an online grocery delivery platform. This project replicates the functionality of Blinkit using modern web development technologies, including React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## **Features**

- User registration and authentication (sign up, login, logout).
- Add items to cart and checkout.
- Browse a variety of groceries, categorized for easy shopping.
- Admin panel to manage products and orders.
- Real-time updates and notifications for orders.
- Fully responsive design.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/keshavSinghania/BLINKIT-REPLICA.git
cd BLINKIT-REPLICA
```

### **2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend**

- **Frontend**: Navigate to the `client` folder and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

- **Backend**: Navigate to the `server` folder and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

### **3. Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the **`server`** folder and define the necessary variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret key).

### **4. Run the project**

- **Frontend**: Start the React development server:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

- **Backend**: Start the Node.js backend server:
```bash
cd ../server
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:5000` (backend).
